# SWE Assessment from Evil Geniuses


## Note:

1. The original code is written on Google Colaboratory in ipython notebook, therefore it is preferred that viewers refer to ipynb file for the assessment. 
The ipynb file can also be accessed at [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nbeNunnt4njw4V2wyfR_Ey77nBR8RlQJ?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nbeNunnt4njw4V2wyfR_Ey77nBR8RlQJ?usp=sharing)
2. If downloaded, the path for parquet_file as well as bombsite b image needed to be changed correspondingly
3. Some interpretaions of the data and questions being asked are made: As one example, I view the match data after Bomb is planted are irrepresentable to some questions.
